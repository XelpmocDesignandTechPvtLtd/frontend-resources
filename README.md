## React

The best place to learn React is from Facebook's documentation.

1. https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html --> this has a good basic tutorial that should get you through React.
2. https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap --> this is a good roadmap that should guide your learning
3. https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react --> this is a good beginner's tutorial
4. https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns --> these are videos about advanced React component patterns. 5. 5. https://hackernoon.com/react-js-a-better-introduction-to-the-most-powerful-ui-library-ever-created-ecd96e8f4621

I would suggest when making react applications, that you start off with Create React App.

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

These resources are more advanced, but worth looking into -

1. https://engineering.hexacta.com/didact-learning-how-react-works-by-building-it-from-scratch-51007984e5c5
2. https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/ --> this is a little old, but very worth looking into, if you want to understand how browsers work.
3. https://www.reactjsvideos.com/#/search --> this has every video from every react conf. So you can keep teaching yourself.
4. https://hackernoon.com/build-your-own-react-48edb8ed350d --> another build your own react course.

I haven't finished this book, but so far it is good. It will give you a solid understanding of how the internet works.

## Redux

1. https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux --> this is a set of videos by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux
2. https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux

The redux docs are really really good -

1. https://redux.js.org/ --> this has a basic tutorial that you can go through.

Some answers I really enjoy -

1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux/32920459#32920459
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32021763/what-could-be-the-downsides-of-using-redux-instead-of-flux/32916602#32916602
   3. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33619775/redux-multiple-stores-why-not/33633850#33633850
      [4] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32968016/how-to-dynamically-load-reducers-for-code-splitting-in-a-redux-application/33044701#33044701

## Javascript

1. https://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/ --> this goes through a lot of the quirks of Javascript2.

## Webpack

1. https://medium.com/@ahsan.ayaz/beginners-guide-to-webpack-how-to-start-a-basic-application-with-webpack-2-ebed3172fa8c
2. https://hackernoon.com/webpack-the-basics-2712a7ad640b

## Git

If you want to become a Git expert, you're only going to need two resources.

1. The official git book is really good and gives you a big picture idea of what Git is doing. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
2. http://gitimmersion.com/ --> this is a hands on course that will teach you git.

## General Programming

1. I haven't gone throught this, but it seems like it could be useful. https://egghead.io/courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript
2. http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/ --> this is a theoretical class I took at Stanford. Very worth doing. A lot of my confidence around computing comes from this class.

## Suggested Projects

It's a little boring, but you can start off by doing our frontend interview and making it work in redux with our dummy api.

https://github.com/XelpmocDesignandTechPvtLtd/frontend-interview-dummy-api

_Note_ you'll need access, so ask Prakash for access and go ahead.

1. Build a live chat application that works with firebase.
2. Build a book shopping website.
3. Build breakout - http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/handouts/19-assignment-3.pdf (this is going to be really hard)
4. Build Yahtzee - http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/handouts/36-assignment-5.pdf (this is going to be really hard)
5. Make up your own.
